A view of the city from Sacr√© Coeur in Montmartre. Or nice romantic dinner in some small side street near Moulin Rouge. If you want to spend a romantic weekend with someone then Paris is the right place.",

Exceptional food and service, in and around the Rue Cler area amazed us in both brasseries and cafes There were just too many to name. Paris is the dining capitol of the world.",
